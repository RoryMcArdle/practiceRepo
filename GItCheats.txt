to clone directory - create directory in Github/ gitlabs, create a README.txt* and copy url

* very important or your repositories will not link correctly

#check that your configs are correct in whatever file you want to place your git directory in.
$ git config --global user.name "Rory"
$ git config --global user.email "r.mcardle@qub.ac.uk"
$ git config --global --list  ( this will show your name and email if done correctly )

in BASH : 
$ git clone http... ( will show your directory being created and linked to your online repo
$ ls  ( to check that repo was made ) 
$ cd ( insert repo name )
$ git status ( returns status of repo ) 
( it should return what branch you are on, that the directory is up to date with online repo and that 
  the working directory is clean with nothing to commit. )

---- GIT COMMANDS ----

git add "" or git stage "" ( adds the file that follows to the staging area where it can be committed )
 
git restore "" ( removes the file from the staging area )

git commit -m "this is the commit comment" ( You can commit any staged changes using this )

git push origin main ( pushes to the first input(online) from the second input(local) )

git pull origin main ( pulls from the first input(online) to the second input(local) )

clear - clears your screen but doesnt affect anything

ls - lists contents of current directory

pwd -lists name of current directory

mkdir "directory" - makes a directory with a given name

rmdir "" - removes given directory if empty

rm "" - deletes a file

rm -rf  "" - deletes a given directory and all attached files

git mv test.txt test1.txt ( renames a file )


 
* anytime this is used in the name of a file the command line 
will auto fill it with what it thinks is the correct ending of thefile name ex ro* could be roryFile.txt
can get complicated if lots of files have similar names


---- FLAGS ----

-a	Gives all files including hidden . files
-l	gives extra information on each output
-1	lists each output 1 to a line
-i	ignores case (grep)


---- MAKING A FILE ----
 you can make a file using :

echo "this is a file" >> aFile.txt ( will make that file and fill it with the quoted text )

notepad fileName.txt ( will either open the named file or can create one if the file doesnt exist )
