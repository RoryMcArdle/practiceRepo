to clone directory - create directory in Github/ gitlabs, create a README.txt* and copy url

* very important or your repositories will not link correctly

#check that your configs are correct in whatever file you want to place your git directory in.
$ git config --global user.name "Rory"
$ git config --global user.email "r.mcardle@qub.ac.uk"
$ git config --global --list  ( this will show your name and email if done correctly )

in BASH : 
$ git clone http... ( will show your directory being created and linked to your online repo
$ ls  ( to check that repo was made ) 
$ cd ( insert repo name )
$ git status ( returns status of repo ) 
( it should return what branch you are on, that the directory is up to date with online repo and that 
  the working directory is clean with nothing to commit. )
